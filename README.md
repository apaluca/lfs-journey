My Linux From Scratch journey


## 17.06.2024

### Reading Progress

Today, I began my Linux From Scratch (LFS) journey using the LFS Book, version 12.1. I covered:

- **Preface:** Provided an overview of the LFS project, explaining its purpose and benefits.
- **Chapter 1: Introduction:** Introduced the project's goals, prerequisites, and tools, emphasizing the educational value of building a Linux system from scratch.

### Additional Reading

I also read two recommended articles:

1. [Software-Building-HOWTO](https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-Building-HOWTO.html)
   - Detailed guide on building software from source, including obtaining, configuring, compiling, and installing software.

2. [Beginner's Guide to Installing Software from Source in Linux](https://moi.vonos.net/linux/beginners-installing-from-source/)
   - Beginner-friendly steps for installing software from source, covering dependencies and troubleshooting tips.

### Summary

Today's activities provided a solid foundation for my LFS journey, combining theoretical knowledge from the book with practical insights from the articles.

### Reading Progress

Today I covered:

- **Chapter 2: Preparing the Host System**
  - Set up the necessary tools and environment for the LFS build, including creating and formatting a new partition, setting up the $LFS variable, and mounting the partition.

- **Chapter 3: Packages and Patches**
  - Collected all the required packages and patches needed for the LFS build, ensuring I have everything ready for the installation process.

- **Chapter 4: Final Preparations**
  - Created a basic directory structure, added a dedicated LFS user, set up the build environment, and learned about Standard Build Units (SBUs) and the importance of test suites.

- **Chapter 5: Compiling a Cross-Toolchain**
  - Built the initial cross-compiler tools, including Binutils, GCC, Linux API headers, Glibc, and the C++ standard library (Libstdc++).

### Summary

Today's activities have laid a strong foundation for my LFS build. I've set up my environment, prepared the necessary tools and packages, and completed the first stages of building a cross-compiler.
