My Linux From Scratch journey

## 18.06.2024

### Reading Progress

Today, I began my Linux From Scratch (LFS) journey using the LFS Book, version 12.01. I covered:

- **Preface:** Provided an overview of the LFS project, explaining its purpose and benefits.
- **Chapter 1: Introduction:** Introduced the project's goals, prerequisites, and tools, emphasizing the educational value of building a Linux system from scratch.

### Additional Reading

I also read two recommended articles:

1. [Software-Building-HOWTO](https://tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-Building-HOWTO.html)
   - Detailed guide on building software from source, including obtaining, configuring, compiling, and installing software.

2. [Beginner's Guide to Installing Software from Source in Linux](https://moi.vonos.net/linux/beginners-installing-from-source/)
   - Beginner-friendly steps for installing software from source, covering dependencies and troubleshooting tips.

### Summary

Today's activities provided a solid foundation for my LFS journey, combining theoretical knowledge from the book with practical insights from the articles.
